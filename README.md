## Technologies:

HTML/CSS/SCSS/JS/React - I used this bunch of technologies, beacause they are great for web application development. I'm confident in using these tech stack (8/10).
I chose React as framework because it provides a component-based architecture, which provides a modularity and reusability of code. Also, it gives an opportunity to controll state of component.

## Libraries:

html2canvas (https://www.npmjs.com/package/html2canvas) - the most popular library that allows you to take "screenshots" of webpages or parts of it, directly on the users browser. I used it for exporting pixel picture from react component as png/jpeg. ()
react-svg (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-svg) - library for embeding SVG picture into the DOM as React component.

# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
