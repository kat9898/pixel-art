## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- HTML (JSX) - for building DOM structure
- CSS/SCSS - for styling DOM elements
- JS/React - for create an interactional elements in the page
  I used this bunch of technologies, beacause they are great for web application development. I'm confident in using these tech stack (8/10).
  I chose React as framework because it provides a component-based architecture, which provides a modularity and reusability of code. Also, it gives an opportunity to controll state of component.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project: (if none, remove the table and explain why)

| Name                                                     | Reason                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [html2canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html2canvas) | For taking "screenshots" of webpages or parts of it, directly on the users browser. I used it for exporting pixel picture from react component as png/jpeg. |
| [react-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-svg)     | For embeding SVG picture into the DOM as React component.                                                                                                   |
